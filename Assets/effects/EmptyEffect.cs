/// <summary>
/// Copyable starter template for a new PenroseArt effect.

/// This class is intentionally excluded from the runtime effect catalog by
/// <see cref="RuntimeCatalogIgnoreAttribute"/>. To create a real effect:
///
/// 1. Copy this file.
/// 2. Rename the file and class to the new effect name.
/// 3. Remove the <c>[RuntimeCatalogIgnore]</c> attribute from the copy.
/// 4. Implement <see cref="Draw"/>.
///
/// Effect lifecycle:
/// - <see cref="Init"/> is called once after reflection creates the effect.
///   Use it for reusable setup, cached geometry, lookup tables, and buffer setup.
/// - <see cref="OnStart"/> is called every time the effect becomes active.
///   Use it for per-run randomization and activation state.
/// - <see cref="Draw"/> is called every frame while the effect is active.
///   Write exactly <c>Penrose.Total</c> colors into <see cref="EffectBase.buffer"/>.
/// - <see cref="OnEnd"/> exists for future cleanup hooks, but Controller does
///   not currently call it.
/// </remarks>
